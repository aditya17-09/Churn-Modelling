This repository contains the code and data for churn modelling analysis. The goal of this analysis is to predict customer churn using a variety of machine learning techniques.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this analysis is the "Bank Customer Churn" dataset provided by Kaggle. This dataset contains information on bank customers, including their demographics, account information, and transaction history. The target variable is whether or not the customer has churned.

Files:

->Churn Modelling.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the churn modelling analysis.
->BankChurners.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used in this analysis.

Dependencies:
This analysis was performed using Python 3. The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

numpy,
pandas,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
scikit-learn,


Usage:

To use this code, simply clone the repository and open the Jupyter notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. The code is commented to explain each step of the analysis.

The BankChurners.csv file contains the data used in this analysis and should be kept in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.
